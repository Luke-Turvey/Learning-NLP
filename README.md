# NLP-Algorithms

In order to learn the concepts of NLP, I have created this repository to put code I created during my learning process. 
I worked through the book "Natural Language Processing in Action" whilst learning so I have used lots of text data from the nlpia github especially when applying algorithms to small sets of data.
However, I have also used many of the corpus's supplied by the NLTK library for my own implementation of certain algorithms when a large corpus was needed.
The code is not as efficient as just using the models pre-built in genism and sklearn but this is because I wanted to program the core of the NLP algorithms myself in order to understand them better. I have used libraries such as sklearn for non-NLP specific data manipulation such as preprocessing.

I have currently created:
- Textrank for Keyword Extraction
- Minimum Edit Distance
- Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes
- TF-IDF Vector Representations (Brown Corpus)
- SMS Spam Filter using LDA Topic Analysis
